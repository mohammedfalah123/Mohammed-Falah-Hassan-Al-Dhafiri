# Improving Robot Path Planning in Linear and Nonlinear Environments Using Hybrid Optimization Algorithms with Advanced Smoothing

**Author:** Mohammed Falah Hassan Al-Dhafiri

Hybrid PSO-DE path planning with advanced smoothing for mobile robots in linear and nonlinear environments.

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid path planning system for mobile robots using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and DE (Differential Evolution) with advanced smoothing techniques. The system is capable of planning efficient, safe, and smooth paths in both linear and nonlinear environments with static and dynamic obstacles.

## Features
- 6 path planning algorithms including PSO, DE, PSO+DE, PSO+GA, and their smoothing variants.
- Advanced smoothing with multiple iterations for optimal path curvature.
- Dynamic obstacle handling.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics: fitness, path length, smoothness, safety, energy, and computation time.
- Unified evaluation for fair comparison between algorithms.

## System Information
- Simulation environment includes both linear and nonlinear spaces.
- Support for multiple static and dynamic obstacles.
- Adjustable path points and algorithm iterations.
- Local planner and controller integrated for realistic simulation.
